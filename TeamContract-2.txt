TEAM CONTRACT

PURPOSE OF THIS CONTRACT:

The purpose of this contract is to help you and your team decide how to manage
your final project for this class. Particularly, how you will meet, and how you 
will collaborate on code, and how you will communicate. 

Please meet regularly as a team. I suggest that you use a recurring in person, 
(or Zoom) meeting for this. It is especially important that each member be 
present for the initial meeting. 

Discuss a strategy for working on the project. In the first phase, you will 
design the database together. The second phase is implementation (SQL, PHP, and 
HTML). You may need to adjust your strategy as you move from the first 
phase to the second; modify this contract accordingly, committing the agreed-upon
changes to your Git repository containing this document.


INSTRUCTIONS:

One of you should create a repo for your team on our GitLab (https://code.centre.edu). 
Call it csc362-proj-[YOUR TEAM NAME]. This project should be different from your 
labs. (See instructions for Lab01.)  As usual, add me as a "Developer". This 
time also add all other members of the team. You should edit this contract on one 
computer and then commit it to git, where each of you can sign your name in a 
separate commit.

Decide on a regular meeting time--at least one regular meeting per week. Come 
to a consensus on when and how. Be realistic. If you cannot be attend, discuss 
this openly as a team.  Also consider the schedule for the term project and how 
it relates to your other commitments (classes, clubs, sports, religious activities, 
etc.)  If there will be points during the semester when it will be difficult or
impossible for you to contribute to the project, you should discuss
this as a team.  For example, you may want to decide now that you will
need to submit a particular deliverable early.

If you make changes to this contract, all team members should come to
agreement. Then commit the revised contract via git.

AGREED MEETING TIME/PLACE/LINK FOR REGULAR WEEKLY TEAM MEETINGS/WORK:

Meetings will be held Mondays from 3-4pm in Olin.



OUR PLAN FOR SUBMITTING THE DELIVERABLES:

[Note: The deadlines are listed below, and it is OK to leave these
unchanged.  However, your team may need to submit one or more
deliverables early due to your team members' constraints and other
commitments.  Of course, you could also choose as a team to submit a
deliverable late--but keep in mind that this will result in a reduced
score of 10 points (out of 100) per day or part of a day late.  The
reason for the penalty is to help teams stay on track and have greater
success in completing the project as a whole.]
