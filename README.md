# TeamJMAN

Team Project DBS f21.

A group project in which we created a database with a user interface using SQL, PHP, HTML, and CSS. 

The database allows trainers to be created and updated, pokemon to be assigned to trainers, moves to be taught to specific pokemon, and pokemon to be traded between trainers.
